# Shem
This is a shell-like program developped in Python. I originally started to develop it on a CASIO 75+E, and finally, I chose to standardize it.
# NOTICE
The program is working on all plateforms (computer, calculators, ...)
For the moment, nothing is saved ; it means that if you entered a password, it will disappear. I work on it.
Nothing is required to install the program. You can run it without doing anything before.

PS : It is my first real project on GitHub, so if I make errors, please notify it to me.
