# Shem
This is a shell-like program developped in Python. I originally started to develop it on a CASIO 75+E, and finally, I chose to standardize it.
# NOTICE
The program is working on all plateforms (computer, calculators, ...)
You could now register with your login and your password, and they will be saved in shadow.txt, so you could always login after closing the program.
Nothing is required to install the program. You can run it without doing anything before.

# Bugs/Problems
The cmatrix() function doesn't really works on computers, I explain : the CASIO 75+E's processor is slow compared to computers' processors, therefore there is a "scroll effect" when you run the command, whereas there isn't on computers.

PS : It is my first real project on GitHub, so if I make errors, please notify it to me.
